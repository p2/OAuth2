/**
    Enhancing the code grant flow by allowing to specify a specific "Basic xx" authorization header.

    This class allows you to manually set the "Authorization" header to a given string, as accepted in its `basicToken` property. It will
    override the superclasses automatic generation of an Authorization header if the client has a clientSecret, so you only need to use
    this subclass if you need a different header (this is different to version 1.2.3 and earlier of this framework).
