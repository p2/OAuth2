- Add `keychain_account_*` settings (thanks @aidzz)
- Workaround for Safari issue (thanks @everlof)

- Make `parseAccessTokenResponseData()` public for non-conformant OAuth2 providers (like Facebook)
- Add overrideable `normalizeAccessTokenResponseKeys()` and `normalizeRefreshTokenResponseKeys()` (inspired by @ChrisTitos)


### 2.2.6

- Make sure extra params are passed to refresh token requests (fixes #105)
- The convenience `request(forURL:)` method by default no longer uses locally cached data


### 2.2.5

### 2.1.1

- Improvements to password grant
- Properly implement dynamic client registration
- Fix issues #47, #59, #61, #66 and improve behavior in several scenarios


### 2.0.2

- Fix issue #53, not detecting canceling the `SFSafariViewController` by the user


### 2.0.1

- Use `SFSafariViewController` for embedded authorization if used on iOS 9+

- Fix _“wrong password”_ detection in password grant, thanks Tim!


### 1.2.7

### 1.2.4

- Make `OAuth2CodeGrant` auto-decide whether to use an “Authorization: Basic ...” header (if the client has a _clientSecret_) or omit it. The option `secretInBody` (called `secret_in_body` in the settings dict) allows to force putting the secret into the request body.


### 1.2.3

- Client uses refresh-tokens automatically, if available. Use the new `authorize()` method to take advantage of this.
